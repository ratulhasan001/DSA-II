Problem 1: Develop C++ program for some basic operations of vector.

Problem 2: Write a C++ program to check whether numbers in a vector can be rearranged so that each number appears exactly once in a consecutive list of numbers. Return true otherwise false.
Example:
1 2 5 0 3 6 7
Check consecutive numbers in the said vector! 0
Problem 3: Write a C++ program to verify that all of the letters in the second string appear in the first string as well. Return true otherwise false.
Example:
Original String elements: Python Py
Check - First string contains all letters from second string: true

Problem 4: Write a C++ program that returns the elements in a vector that are strictly smaller than their adjacent left and right neighbors.
Example:
Original Vector elements:
1250317
Vector elements that are smaller than its adjacent neighbors:
0
